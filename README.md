üõ∞Ô∏è Applied Data Science Capstone ‚Äì SpaceX Landing Prediction
This repository contains my final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The objective was to apply the complete data science methodology to a real-world scenario: predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landings.

üöÄ Project Overview
SpaceX has revolutionized space travel by developing reusable rocket technology, significantly reducing launch costs. A critical aspect of this innovation is the successful landing of the first-stage boosters. Predicting these landings can provide insights into mission success and cost savings.

In this project, I assumed the role of a data scientist at a startup aiming to compete with SpaceX. The goal was to analyze historical launch data and build predictive models to determine the likelihood of a successful first-stage landing.
